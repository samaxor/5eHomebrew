In the beliefs of the dōbutsu, when one does obtain a goal of note they might change their name to one of a god or demon. No matter how much the dōbutsu may obtain they will still have a constant feeling that they should not hold political power. In the exception to this rule, dōbutsu that do create their own nation will often be isolated. The people that leave an isolated village might be hunted down to keep the secrets and tradition a mystery.
