				"Often manifested in clerics who worship Lord Ao or Chauntea, those under the protection domain try to heal the sick and prevent more harm. On account of this, they do not usually partake in causing even more harm, including to their enemies. They are pacifists who would prefer to talk things out, but still defend themselves when required. Very few will take arms against an enemy. Many will carry a simple dagger, but that can be used in a pinch to cut bandages. Others will stretch their calling into battle, bulking in armor and shields to not be hurt. Their way of thinking is that if they're unable to be hurt from a deadly blow, they can step in place of an attack to an ally.",
